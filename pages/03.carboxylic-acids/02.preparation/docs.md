## General methods of preparation of Carboxylic Acids

1. **Oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes**: Strong oxidising agent like K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> can oxidise primary alcohol to aldehyde and if the aldehyde is not removed from the reaction mixture, it is oxidised to carboxylic acids.

Mild oxidising agents like Tollen’s reagent or Fehling’s solution could oxidise aldehydes to carboxylic acids readily.

!!! **Note**: Refer to the mechanism of reactions of aldehydes with Tollen's reagent and Fehling's Solution. 

2. **Oxidation of alkyl benzenes**: Aromatic carboxylic acids can be commercially prepared from alkylbenzenes using strong oxidizing agents like KMnO<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>.

3. **Hydrolysis of acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, and amides**: These compounds which are known as acyl derivatives can be hydrolysed to produce carboxylic acids.

The ease of hydrolysis of the acyl derivatives is in the following order:

4. **Hydrolysis of nitriles**: Nitriles give carboxylic acids on hydrolysis by boiling with acid or alkali. Nitriles are first converted to amides then to carboxylic acid.
